              My name is Bhupendra Saini, and I am from Dausa,Rajasthan. I have
              completed my graduation from Poornima University, Jaipur, in April
              2024. I passed my 10th grade with 73% and 12th grade with 90% from
              Science Campus School, Mandawar, Dausa. I am passionate about web
              development and have built a strong foundation in front-end
              technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have
              successfully completed several projects where I applied these
              skills to create responsive and interactive websites. Currently, I
              am continuously learning new tools and frameworks like Tailwind
              CSS and React to enhance my development skills.and I have been
              working as a Frontend Developer at Sudotech. I am a quick learner
              who believes in learning from past mistakes and experiences.
              Thatâ€™s all about me. Thank you!
